Dispensaries cannot sell edibles, but medical cannabis products could be mixed into food or drinks by patients themselves. Vaporization (or oils) is allowed, but smoking is prohibited. Patients may only obtain a 30-day supply of cannabis at a time. It is not clear who will determine the definition of a 30-day supply.\n\n**Access**: Home cultivation is not allowed. Patients will be allowed to obtain cannabis from regulated dispensaries once they are up and running. In addition, the bureau may enter into agreements with other states to allow terminally ill cancer patients to buy medical cannabis in another state.\n\n**Per Se DUID Law**: Patients will be forbidden from driving and from undertaking some other activities if they have more than three nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood serum. This standard could make it illegal for some patients to ever drive, since many patients have THC levels at this amount or greater many hours or days after last administering cannabis.\n\n**Local Bans**: Counties may ban medical cannabis businesses entirely or may limit their locations within the county.','2017-04-18 03:16:31','2017-04-18 03:16:31'),(370,723,2,'This should definitely help put a dent in opiate addiction there.
