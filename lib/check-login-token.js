/*
This middleware is setup as a function that returns a middleware closure
Since checking the login token requires access to the database through the RedditAPI,
this function receives the reddit API object and then returns a middleware.

The middleware will check request.cookies for a SESSION token. if it exists, the middleware will
check through RedditAPI if the token represents a valid user. If it does, then the user object will
be added to the request object. this means any code that runs after this middleware will have a
.user property under the request object if there is a logged in user.
